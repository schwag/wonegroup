				<p>During the discovery phase we interview the client to gather all of the requirements and goals for their campaigns.
				Once we have these requirements we can then begin to identify the types of ad campaigns to include, campaign settings, 
				keywords and placements to research, demographics, budget estimates, reporting structure, and estimated time for us 
				to manage the campaigns. After the initial discovery phase, the ongoing discovery phase is specific to campaign performance
				and helps us identify the optimizations that need to take place.</p>
	        	<p>The deliverable for the discovery phase is a detailed report&#47;plan that contains the following:</p> 
				<ul>
					<li>Campaign Types &amp; Settings</li>
					<li>Ad Group Themes</li>
					<li>Ad Creative &amp; Copy</li>
					<li>Targeted Keywords</li>
					<li>Targeted Placements, Demographics, &amp; Interests</li>
					<li>Metrics &amp; KPI's</li>
					<li>Estimated Budget</li>
					<li>Budget Performance</li>
					<li>Bid Strategy</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Once the discovery phase identifies all of the requirements needed for the campaigns we carefully install and 
				configure all of the campaigns and their components. The client will receive a breakdown of the time and 
				activities that were performed to initially develop, install, and configure all of the campaigns. The 
				activities that we perform in this phase are as follows: </p> 
				<ul>
					<li>Install Campaign Settings</li>
					<li>Ad Group Set&#45;up</li>
					<li>Install Targeted Keywords</li>
					<li>Install Placements &amp; Targeting</li>
					<li>Write Multiple Ads</li>
					<li>Design Creative</li>
					<li>Write Custom Bid Rules</li>
					<li>Install Analytics Configurations</li>
					<li>Set&#45;up Conversion Tracking</li>

				<p>Once the initial implementation is complete it's time to turn to the analytics and start using the data
				to optimize the campaigns for the goals and objectives set forth in the discovery phase. Each month we conduct a 
				thorough review of the analytics to discover opportunities and pitfalls that dictate our daily tasks necessary to optimize campaign performance.</p>
				<p>Common optimization tasks that we perform are as follows:</p> 
				<ul>
					<li>Keyword Adjustments</li>
					<li>Constant Ad Copy Tests</li>
					<li>Campaign Experiments</li>
					<li>Bid Adjustments</li>
					<li>Landing Page Optimization</li>
					<li>Display Network Placement Adjustments</li>
					<li>Add and Take Away Ad Group Themes</li>
