	        	<p>Display advertising and remarketing are very effective for building awareness about your
	        	brand, product, or service and also bring previous site visitors back to the site to complete
	        	a desired action.</p> 
				<p>For traditional display ads we build beautiful creative in multiple formats and use Google Adword's
				advanced targeting features to present your ad to the most appropriate audience via the Google Display 
				Network (GDN). Traditional display ads
				are generally used to build awareness as opposed to eliciting a direct response.</p>
				<p>Remarketing allows you to reach people who previously visited your website, providing a powerful way
				to match the right people with the right message. An example of this would be targeting customers who 
				added items to a shopping cart but didn't complete the purchase.</p>

	        	<p>Most people turn to Google when researching products that they are interested in. As those
	        	people are searching they are now seeing product listings complete with prices, images, and descriptions
	        	to increase their experience when seeking out their desired product.</p> 
				<p>This fairly new platform that Google has introduced provides a tremendous opportunity for ecommerce
				companies to get in early and gain more exposure for their products at very reasonable prices</p>
				<p>In order to implement an effective Google Shopping Campaign you must first develop and maintain a quality data
				feed (i.e. product database) to deliver your products to the Google Search results. Based on your 
				company's strategy we can build out and manage a quality data feed to match your strategy and deliver successful 
				results. An example of this might be to segment products by top sellers or top products by profit margin
				and implement competitive bids to make sure those products are most visible to people searching for those
				products. A healthy Google Shopping campaign requires a successful blend of technical expertise and
				a carefully planned strategy. Our Google Shopping capabilities are as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Data Feed Development and Management</li>
					<li>Develop Custom Campaign Structure </li>
					<li>Dynamic Product Remarketing</li>

				<p>YouTube has integrated video ads within Adwords that allow organizations to market
				their video content to their users who conduct over 4 billion video streams per day. YouTube also happens
				to be the second largest search engine behind Google. When 52&#37; of users take action as a result of watching
				a video ad on YouTube, it is imperative that organizations incorporate video ads into their marketing strategy.</p>
				<p>We develop and manage video campaigns that reach a highly engaged audience with relevant video
				content and control your budget with pay-per-view ads, which means you are only charged when a user watches your
				video for at least 30 seconds. We also use video analytics to implement remarketing campaigns that target users
				who were highly engaged with your video content.</p>
